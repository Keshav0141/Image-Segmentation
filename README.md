# üñºÔ∏è Image Segmentation using Deep Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Image-Segmentation.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to perform **image segmentation** using **deep learning models**.  
Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into meaningful regions (e.g., background vs objects, or multiple semantic classes).

---

## üéØ Objective
- Preprocess and prepare an image dataset for segmentation.  
- Train a deep learning model to classify each pixel into meaningful categories.  
- Visualize segmentation masks vs ground truth.  
- Evaluate model accuracy with pixel-level metrics.  

---

## üìå Key Features
- **Data Preparation**  
  - Image resizing and normalization  
  - Train/validation/test split  
  - Data augmentation (flipping, rotation, scaling)  
  - Handling segmentation masks (binary or multi-class)  

- **Model Architectures**  
  - **U-Net** (baseline for medical & general segmentation)  
  - Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)  
  - Encoder‚ÄìDecoder based architectures  
  - Transfer learning with pretrained backbones (e.g., VGG, ResNet, MobileNet)  

- **Training**  
  - Loss functions: Binary Cross-Entropy, Dice Loss, or a combination  
  - Optimizers: Adam, RMSprop  
  - Early stopping and learning rate scheduling  

- **Evaluation**  
  - Pixel Accuracy  
  - Intersection over Union (IoU)  
  - Dice Coefficient (F1-score at pixel level)  
  - Visual comparisons: input vs ground truth vs predicted mask
